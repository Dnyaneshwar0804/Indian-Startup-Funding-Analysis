# Startup Funding Data Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project analyzes startup funding data from `startup_funding.csv`. It performs data cleaning, transformation, aggregation, and visualization to uncover trends such as:

* Funding patterns over time
* Top sectors, cities, startups, and investors
* Popular investment types

The analysis includes both numerical summaries and visualizations.

## ðŸ“‚ Features

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**

   * Reads CSV file using Pandas
   * Removes unnecessary columns (`Remarks`)
   * Fills missing values with `"Unknown"`
   * Cleans numerical and date formats
   * Standardizes text fields (lowercase, no extra spaces, removes non-ASCII)

2. **Feature Engineering**

   * Extracts `FundingYear` and `FundingMonth` from the funding date

3. **Data Aggregations**

   * Yearly and monthly funding trends
   * Top 10 sectors, cities, and startups by funding
   * Top 10 investors by total funding and number of deals
   * Investment types by funding and deal count

4. **Visualizations**

   * Line plots for funding trends
   * Bar charts for top sectors, cities, startups, investors, and investment types

* Any missing or malformed data is handled gracefully.
